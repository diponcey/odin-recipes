This is my first project for The Odin Project. It will be a basic recipes webpage.

I will include all the topics learned in the previous lessons, this includes:

- Creating a html file
- Using paragraphs, bold and italic text, headings and lists.
- Ordered lists and unordered list
- Links to other webpages and linking images
